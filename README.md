**Recommendations:**
  * Men spent more money than women, So the company should focus on retaining the male customers and getting more male customers.
  * Product_Category - 1, 5, 8, & 11 have the highest purchasing frequency. it means these are the products in these categories are liked more by customers. Company can focus on selling more of these products or selling more of the products which are purchased less.
  * Unmarried customers spend more money than married customers, So the company should focus on acquisition of Unmarried customers.
  * Customers in the age 18-45 spend more money than the others, So company should focus on acquisition of customers who are in the age 18-45
  * Male customers living in City_Category C spend more money than other male customers living in B or C, Selling more products in the City_Category C will help the company increase the revenue.
